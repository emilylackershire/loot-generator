# Project: Loot Generator

Authors: Emily Lackershrie

## Resources

+ Java 17
+ Visual Studio Code
+ Instructions provided from Professor Osera of Grinnell College, accessed through his website: 
  https://osera.cs.grinnell.edu/ttap/data-structures-labs/loot-generator.html
+ git & github
+ in order to parse the document to get the strings that I wanted, I needed more functions that I didn't know so I read the Oracle Java docs to find out more about strings:
  https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html
